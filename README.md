# Repository maintenance

This repository is to standardize the developer environment of Python packages
by the [ComPWA organization](https://github.com/ComPWA). The maintenance is
performed through [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com).

See also the [develop](https://pwa.readthedocs.io/develop.html) page on the
[PWA pages](https://pwa.readthedocs.io).

## Usage

Add a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file to your repository with the following
content:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/ComPWA/repo-maintenance
    rev: 0.0.2
    hooks:
      - id: check-dev-files
      - id: fix-first-nbcell
      - id: fix-nbformat-version
```

This example lists all available hooks (listed here as `id`s) â€• you can remove
some of them.
